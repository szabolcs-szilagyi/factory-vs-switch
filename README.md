# Factory vs Switches

This demo repository meant to demonstrate the differences, when using a
`swtich-case` (or `if-elseif-else`) versus a factory pattern.

In this repo you can see how simple and easy to follow the solution that uses
`switch-case` solution. But also when you compare it with the `factory`
implementation you can see how rigid is the naive solution. As soon as you need
to add a bit of customisation to the `switch-case` solution you will end up
adding `if` cases one after the other.

Note that I'm not suggesting that all `switch-case` solutions are bad! They are
good up to the point where you don't need any extra customisation and till there
are just a handful of options. Its okay to start out with a simple `switch-case`
solution, but as soon as you have customisation or adding the 4th, 5th case
coming in, then you should refactor it.

Also worth noting that this is true from the other side as well: the pattern
shown here has a few indirections (e.g. the `proxy-child), that will make it
hard to understand at first glance, specially if you have no experience with it.
So if you have 2-3 cases to cover a switch-case is cleaner and easier to
understand.

Example for customisation with the factory pattern is the `races` component:
data is passed down, but then further enhanced with extra details.
